- **Responsive Design**: Understanding how to implement responsive layouts that adapt to different screen sizes.
- **React**: Building components that are reusable and easy to manage.

## Continued Development

For future improvements, I plan to:

- Implement additional animations to enhance user interaction.
- Improve accessibility by adding ARIA labels and ensuring better keyboard navigation.
- Refactor components for better readability and maintenance.
